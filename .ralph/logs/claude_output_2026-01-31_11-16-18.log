It's reading PROMPT.md (which tells it what to do), then it should be working on fix_plan.md tasks.\n\n## What You Should Do:\n\n**Just wait and watch the tmux dashboard.** Ralph is working. The PROMPT.md you're seeing is Ralph reading its instructions - that's normal!\n\nIf Ralph keeps looping without making progress (hitting circuit breaker again), the issue is that **Claude inside Ralph is explaining instead of doing work**. \n\nLet me know if Ralph completes Loop #3 or if it hits the circuit breaker again. If it fails again, we may need to try a different approach - possibly running the scaffolding manually first, then letting Ralph handle the detailed tasks.","session_id":"be7bf28e-429b-4170-a4e6-9253818bb3fc","total_cost_usd":0.5580667500000001,"usage":{"input_tokens":19,"cache_creation_input_tokens":113877,"cache_read_input_tokens":388440,"output_tokens":673,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":113877}},"modelUsage":{"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":3294,"outputTokens":210,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.004344000000000001,"contextWindow":200000},"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929":{"inputTokens":19,"outputTokens":673,"cacheReadInputTokens":388440,"cacheCreationInputTokens":113877,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.55372275,"contextWindow":200000}},"permission_denials":[{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_use_id":"toolu_013RJ3ChzzjBfgfPpoQUq4A3","tool_input":{"command":"tmux list-sessions 2>/dev/null || echo \"No tmux sessions running\"","description":"Check for active tmux sessions"}}],"uuid":"65a2cbec-39f5-4909-875f-cb2e24fed998"}
