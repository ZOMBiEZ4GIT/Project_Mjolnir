Let me clarify what's happening:\n\n**You don't need to show me this file** - this is the prompt that **Ralph (the autonomous loop) will read** when it runs.\n\n## 🎯 What You Should Do Now:\n\nJust run this command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\ncaffeinate -i ~/.local/bin/ralph --monitor\n```\n\nThat's it! Ralph will:\n1. Read the `.ralph/PROMPT.md` file you keep showing me\n2. Read `.ralph/fix_plan.md` to see what tasks to do\n3. Start implementing the W-1 Project Scaffolding tasks autonomously\n4.
