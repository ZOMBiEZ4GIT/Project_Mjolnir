It's reading PROMPT.md (which tells it what to do), then it should be working on fix_plan.md tasks.\n\n## What You Should Do:\n\n**Just wait and watch the tmux dashboard.** Ralph is working. The PROMPT.md you're seeing is Ralph reading its instructions - that's normal!\n\nIf Ralph keeps looping without making progress (hitting circuit breaker again), the issue is that **Claude inside Ralph is explaining instead of doing work**. \n\nLet me know if Ralph completes Loop #3 or if it hits the circuit breaker again. If it fails again, we may need to try a different approach - possibly running the scaffolding manually first, then letting Ralph handle the detailed tasks.",
