## Codebase Patterns
- Project uses Next.js 14+ App Router with TypeScript
- Drizzle ORM is already installed (drizzle-orm, drizzle-kit, @neondatabase/serverless)
- shadcn/ui components available in components/ui
- Dark mode only - no light mode support
- Quality checks: `npm run build` and `npm run lint`
- ESLint 9 with flat config format (eslint.config.mjs) - do not use .eslintrc.json
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui CSS variable pattern using HSL format: hsl(var(--variable))
- CSS variables stored without hsl() wrapper e.g. --background: 240 10% 3.9%
- Glow shadows use rgba() since HSL variables can't express box-shadow alpha
- Inter font loaded via next/font/google in app/layout.tsx (applied via inter.className on body)
- Framer Motion components require "use client" directive
- Toast notifications use Sonner - import toast from sonner
- Dashboard navigation uses components/layout/sidebar.tsx and components/layout/mobile-nav.tsx
- Tailwind has semantic tokens: text-positive/bg-positive (green), text-negative/bg-negative (red), shadow-glow-sm/md/lg, shadow-glow-positive, shadow-glow-negative, shadow-card, shadow-card-hover
- Layout & spacing constants live in lib/theme.ts (sidebarWidth, cardRadius, spacing xs→2xl) — use instead of magic numbers
- Animation presets live in lib/animations.ts — import and spread onto motion.div elements (e.g. `<motion.div {...fadeIn}>`)
- Stagger presets (staggerContainer, staggerItem) use Variants type with "hidden"/"visible" keys — use with variants prop
- numberSpring is a Transition object for animating numeric values (e.g. useSpring, useMotionValue)
- Reduced motion: use `useReducedMotion()` from framer-motion directly — returns boolean for OS prefers-reduced-motion
- Hooks live in hooks/ directory (not lib/) — follow this convention for custom React hooks
- Recharts SVG props (stroke, fill) require raw hex values — CSS variables not supported in SVG rendering
- Category indicator colours (asset types, currencies) use hardcoded Tailwind colours (bg-blue-500 etc.) — these are intentional and distinct from theme tokens
- Card container pattern: `border-border bg-card/50` for bordered cards, `bg-muted` for skeleton placeholders
- Error state pattern: `border-destructive bg-destructive/10` with `text-destructive` for error messages
- Toggle pattern: active=`bg-muted text-foreground`, inactive=`text-muted-foreground hover:text-foreground`
- Form validation pattern: `border-destructive focus-visible:ring-destructive` on inputs, `text-destructive` on error messages
- Delete confirm button: `bg-destructive hover:bg-destructive/90 text-foreground`; cancel: `bg-card border-border text-foreground hover:bg-muted`
- Select dropdowns: `bg-background border-border text-muted-foreground` for trigger, `focus:bg-card focus:text-foreground` for items
- Warning/info colours (yellow-*, blue-*) are semantic and intentionally NOT part of design token migration
- Interactive toggle buttons (show/hide contributions): use `text-primary hover:text-primary/80` pattern
- html2canvas backgroundColor requires raw hex — use `#18181b` to match --card token
- Email templates (components/emails/) use inline hex values — email clients don't support CSS variables
- Only legitimate remaining hardcoded grey: `bg-gray-500` fallback in category indicator functions (asset-allocation, currency-exposure)
- Navigation items defined in lib/navigation.ts — import navItems and NavItem type from there (sidebar, mobile nav, command menu)
- New layout components live in components/layout/ — NavItemLink (nav-item.tsx) uses Framer Motion layoutId='active-nav' for animated active pill
- TooltipProvider with delayDuration={0} wraps collapsed nav items for instant tooltip display
- Sidebar collapse state persists in localStorage ('mjolnir-sidebar-collapsed') — use mounted state pattern to avoid hydration mismatch
- Sidebar is fixed positioned; content area needs dynamic left margin matching sidebar width (240px or 64px)
- AppShell (components/layout/app-shell.tsx) owns sidebar collapsed state — Sidebar receives isCollapsed/onToggleCollapsed as props
- Content area uses CSS custom property --sidebar-width with responsive Tailwind class ml-0 lg:ml-[var(--sidebar-width)] for responsive dynamic margin
- For responsive dynamic values, use CSS custom properties + Tailwind arbitrary value classes (inline styles can't be responsive)
- PageWrapper (components/layout/page-wrapper.tsx) wraps page content with fade transition — placed inside DashboardErrorBoundary in dashboard layout
- Mobile header (components/layout/mobile-nav.tsx) is fixed h-14 z-30 — content area needs pt-14 on mobile
- Sheet drawer (shadcn/ui) handles focus trapping and Escape close via Radix Dialog primitive
- Focus ring pattern: `focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring` matches shadcn/ui conventions
- Shared UI components (e.g. SpeedDial) live in `components/shared/` directory
- To open AddHoldingDialog/AddTransactionDialog programmatically: pass a hidden `<button ref={ref} />` as children, then call `ref.current?.click()`
- CheckInModal uses controlled `open`/`onOpenChange` props — can be opened from any external trigger
- HoldingsTable hybrid grouping: `typeFilter="all"` shows collapsible grouped sections, specific type shows flat list via `HoldingsFlatSection`
- Shared table rendering: `HoldingsTableContent` component handles row rendering for both grouped and flat views
- GroupHeader (components/holdings/group-header.tsx) shows label, count, total value, portfolio % badge — receives calculated values as props
- `calculateGroupTotal()` in holdings-table.tsx converts holdings to display currency — use for any group-level value aggregation
- `motion.create(TableRow)` creates a motion-enhanced `MotionTableRow` for stagger animations on table rows
- Stagger rows use `motion.tbody` as container with `variants` + `initial="hidden" animate="visible"` pattern
- Capped stagger: `Math.min(0.05, 0.5 / count)` ensures total stagger completes within 500ms regardless of row count
- `useReducedMotion()` from framer-motion checks OS prefers-reduced-motion — skip animations entirely when true
- Dormant holdings sorted to bottom of each group via `useMemo` sort in `HoldingsTableContent` and `HoldingsCurrencySection`
- EmptyState component (`components/ui/empty-state.tsx`) is shared across holdings, snapshots, transactions — keep prop API stable
- `AnimatePresence mode="popLayout"` on HoldingsTable wraps content keyed by typeFilter — handles enter/exit on tab change
- Holdings table rows are clickable (navigate to `/holdings/[id]`) — action buttons use `stopPropagation` to prevent row click
- Row hover: `hover:bg-accent/5 hover:scale-[1.005] active:bg-accent/10` with `transition-[background-color,transform] duration-150`
- Filter tabs (components/holdings/filter-tabs.tsx) use Framer Motion layoutId for animated sliding indicator
- scrollbar-hide utility class added to globals.css for hidden scrollbar on overflow-x-auto elements

# UX-4 Transaction UI Enhancement Progress Log

Started: 2026-02-06

---

## 2026-02-06 - US-001
- Created `components/transactions/type-selector.tsx` — animated tab bar with BUY/SELL/DIVIDEND/SPLIT options
- Sliding background indicator using Framer Motion `layoutId="active-transaction-type"`
- Colour-coded: BUY=positive/green, SELL=destructive/red, DIVIDEND=accent/purple, SPLIT=blue-400/blue-500
- Controlled component with `value`, `onChange`, `disabled` props
- Disabled mode: shows active type but prevents interaction, reduces opacity on inactive tabs
- Follows same pattern as `filter-tabs.tsx` (layoutId sliding indicator)
- Files changed: `components/transactions/type-selector.tsx` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TypeSelector exports `TransactionType` type — import from `type-selector.tsx` instead of `add-transaction-dialog.tsx`
  - Uses `bg-muted p-1` container with `rounded-lg` for the pill-bar look
  - layoutId must be unique per AnimatePresence scope — used `"active-transaction-type"` to avoid conflicts with other layoutIds
---

## 2026-02-06 - US-002
- Refactored `add-transaction-dialog.tsx` from manual useState to react-hook-form + zod
- Installed react-hook-form, zod, @hookform/resolvers; added shadcn/ui form component
- Created unified `formSchema` with z.coerce.number() fields; per-action validation in onSubmit
- Replaced RadioGroup with TypeSelector from US-001
- Preserved two-step flow: Step 1 (holding + type) → Step 2 (details via react-hook-form)
- SELL validation checks available quantity and prevents overselling
- Real-time calculated totals using form.watch()
- Files changed: `components/transactions/add-transaction-dialog.tsx`, `components/ui/form.tsx` (new), `package.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - z.coerce.number() has input type `unknown` — causes TS mismatch with useForm<FormValues>. Fix: cast resolver as `zodResolver(schema) as unknown as Resolver<FormValues>`
  - Import `Resolver` type from `react-hook-form` for the cast
  - For numeric inputs with z.coerce, pass `field.value ?? ""` to prevent "undefined" showing; use `e.target.value === "" ? "" : e.target.value` for onChange to allow clearing
  - Unified schema approach (single schema + onSubmit validation) is simpler than discriminated union schemas with refine
---

## 2026-02-06 - US-003
- Refactored `edit-transaction-dialog.tsx` from manual useState/errors to react-hook-form + zod
- Uses same `formSchema` and `FormValues` type as add dialog for consistency
- `useForm` pre-populated with transaction data via `form.reset()` in useEffect when dialog opens
- Replaced manual Label+Input+error with FormField/FormControl/FormMessage components
- Added TypeSelector in disabled mode (shows action type visually but prevents interaction)
- SELL validation accounts for the transaction being edited: `availableForSell = currentQuantity + originalSellQty`
- Holding name, currency, and action type displayed as read-only info above the form
- Real-time calculated totals using `form.watch()`
- Uses toast for error feedback (simplified from inline server errors)
- Files changed: `components/transactions/edit-transaction-dialog.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Edit dialogs need `form.reset()` in useEffect keyed on `[open, transaction, form]` to sync form with new transaction data
  - For edit dialogs, simplified `onError` to just toast (no inline server errors) since form validation catches most issues client-side
  - TypeSelector `disabled` prop + empty `onChange={() => {}}` provides clean read-only display of transaction type
---

## 2026-02-06 - US-004
- Created `components/transactions/transaction-summary.tsx` — 4 summary cards (Total Bought, Total Sold, Dividends Received, Net Cash Flow)
- Cards use staggerContainer/staggerItem animation presets from lib/animations.ts
- Grid responsive: 1 col mobile, 2 cols md, 4 cols lg+
- Each card shows label, formatted dollar amount (via CurrencyDisplay), and transaction count
- Colour-coded: Bought=text-positive, Sold=text-destructive, Dividends=text-accent, Net=dynamic based on sign
- Uses design tokens: bg-card/50, border-border
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion via useReducedMotion()
- Updated transactions page to compute per-action counts in aggregatedTotals useMemo
- Removed TableFooter (aggregated totals now shown in summary cards above table)
- Summary cards respect current filter state (holding, action, currency) since they consume the same aggregatedTotals derived from filtered transactions
- Files changed: `components/transactions/transaction-summary.tsx` (new), `app/(dashboard)/transactions/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - AggregatedTotals interface extended with `buyCount`, `sellCount`, `dividendCount`, `totalCount`, `displayCurrencyCode` for summary card consumption
  - `displayCurrencyCode` precomputed in useMemo: uses display currency if mixed, otherwise the common native currency — avoids currency logic in child components
  - Card container pattern: `border border-border bg-card/50 p-4 rounded-lg` for consistent card look
---

## 2026-02-06 - US-005
- Grouped transactions by month with sticky headers in the transactions page
- Added helper functions: `getMonthKey()` (extracts YYYY-MM), `formatMonthLabel()` (formats as "February 2026"), `TransactionGroup` interface
- Added `transactionGroups` useMemo that groups transactions by month key, sorted reverse chronologically
- Replaced flat `transactions.map()` with `transactionGroups.map()` rendering `Fragment` per group
- Month headers: full-width `TableRow` with `colSpan={8}`, sticky `top-0 z-20 bg-background`, `border-b border-border`
- Month header displays: month/year name (left, `text-sm font-semibold`), transaction count (right, `text-xs text-muted-foreground`)
- Grouping recalculates automatically when filters change since `transactionGroups` depends on `transactions` query data
- Empty months naturally excluded — only months with transactions appear
- Files changed: `app/(dashboard)/transactions/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `Fragment` (not `<>`) when mapping groups that need keys — shorthand fragments can't accept key props
  - `colSpan={8}` must match actual column count in the table for sticky headers to span full width
  - Sticky headers in tables: use `sticky top-0 z-20 bg-background` on the TableCell (not TableRow) to ensure proper stacking context
  - `getMonthKey()` using `dateString.slice(0, 7)` is simpler and safer than date parsing for YYYY-MM-DD strings
---

## 2026-02-06 - US-006
- Added stagger animation and row hover effects to transaction table rows
- Created `MotionTableRow` via `motion.create(TableRow)` — same pattern as holdings table
- Replaced `<TableBody>` with `<motion.tbody>` using container/row variants for stagger animation
- Wrapped tbody in `AnimatePresence mode="wait"` keyed by filter state (`filterKey`) for exit/enter on filter change
- Row hover: `hover:bg-accent/5` with `transition-[background-color] duration-150`
- Capped stagger delay: `Math.min(0.05, 0.5 / count)` — 50ms per row, total animation within 500ms
- Exit animation: fade out (100ms) when filters change, new rows stagger in
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`: `useReducedMotion()` → sets duration: 0 and skips y-transform variants
- Removed unused `TableBody` import since motion.tbody replaced it
- Files changed: `app/(dashboard)/transactions/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When replacing `<TableBody>` with `<motion.tbody>`, remember to remove unused `TableBody` import or lint will fail
  - `AnimatePresence mode="wait"` ensures exit completes before enter — use for filter-change transitions
  - `filterKey` pattern (concatenating all filter values) gives a single key for AnimatePresence to detect filter changes
  - Month headers (sticky `<TableRow>`) don't need animation variants — only data rows use `MotionTableRow`
---

## 2026-02-06 - US-007
- Polished transaction type badges with consistent design tokens
- Updated `getActionColorClass()` in page.tsx: separated BUY and DIVIDEND (were sharing same colour), gave DIVIDEND `bg-accent/20 text-accent` to match type-selector and summary cards
- Fixed SPLIT badge from hardcoded `bg-blue-900 text-blue-300` to `bg-blue-500/20 text-blue-400`
- Changed badge shape from `rounded` to `rounded-full` (pill-shaped) with normalized `px-2 py-0.5` padding
- Verified colour scheme consistency across all three components: table badges (page.tsx), type selector (type-selector.tsx), summary cards (transaction-summary.tsx)
- Files changed: `app/(dashboard)/transactions/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Transaction action colour mapping is defined in three places: `getActionColorClass()` in page.tsx, `TYPE_COLOURS` in type-selector.tsx, and card `colorClass` in transaction-summary.tsx — keep all three in sync
  - SPLIT uses hardcoded `text-blue-400`/`bg-blue-500/20` intentionally — there's no semantic "info" token in the design system
  - The previous code grouped BUY and DIVIDEND together as both "green" — they should be distinct (BUY=positive/green, DIVIDEND=accent/purple)
---

## 2026-02-06 - US-008
- Added success confirmation animations on transaction save/edit/delete
- **Highlight animation:** `highlightedTransactionId` state tracks which row was just saved — Framer Motion animates `backgroundColor` from `accent/0.1` → transparent over 1s
- **Deletion fade-out:** `deletingTransactionId` state tracks which row is being removed — animates with `opacity: 0, x: -20` over 300ms, then state clears after 400ms
- Added `onTransactionSaved` callback prop to `AddTransactionDialog` and `EditTransactionDialog` — passes transaction ID back to parent
- Added `onDeleted` callback prop to `DeleteTransactionDialog` — fires after successful deletion
- Toast messages already use `toast.success()` from Sonner which shows checkmark icon by default
- Delete toast changed from "Transaction deleted successfully" to "Transaction deleted" for brevity
- Both highlight and deletion animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` via `shouldReduceMotion` (durations set to 0)
- Highlight auto-clears after 1.5s via `setTimeout` with `useRef` for cleanup on unmount
- Files changed: `app/(dashboard)/transactions/page.tsx`, `components/transactions/add-transaction-dialog.tsx`, `components/transactions/edit-transaction-dialog.tsx`, `components/transactions/delete-transaction-dialog.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - API POST `/api/transactions` returns the full created object with `.id` via Drizzle `.returning()` — safe to extract ID from response for callbacks
  - For row-level Framer Motion animations that override stagger variants, set `animate` to an object (not a variant name) — this overrides the parent's variant-driven animation
  - `isDeleting` rows should get `pointer-events-none` to prevent interaction during fade-out
  - `useRef` for timer cleanup prevents stale closure issues and memory leaks on fast unmount/remount
---

## 2026-02-06 - US-009
- Audited all files in `components/transactions/` and `app/(dashboard)/transactions/page.tsx` for hardcoded colours
- **Result:** All transaction components are already fully using design tokens — no changes needed
- Previous stories (US-001 through US-008) already migrated all green/red/grey/white colours to semantic tokens
- Verified: `bg-positive/20 text-positive` (BUY), `bg-destructive/20 text-destructive` (SELL), `bg-accent/20 text-accent` (DIVIDEND), `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`, `bg-card/50`, `border-border`, `bg-background`, `bg-muted/50`
- Remaining hardcoded colours are intentionally exempt: `text-yellow-*`/`bg-yellow-*` (warning), `text-blue-400`/`bg-blue-500/20` (SPLIT info) — per codebase patterns these are semantic and NOT part of design token migration
- Filter dropdowns: already using `bg-background border-border text-foreground`
- Empty state: uses shared `EmptyState` component with token-based styles
- Typecheck (`npm run build`) and lint (`npm run lint`) both pass
- Files changed: `tasks/prd.json`, `tasks/progress.txt` (no code changes needed)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When previous stories incrementally migrate colours, audit stories may find no remaining work — this is a success case
  - Yellow/blue hardcoded colours are intentionally kept as semantic colours (warning/info) and should NOT be replaced with design tokens
