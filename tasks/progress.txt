# Ralph Progress Log — bi-d-enrichment
# Budget Intelligence Phase D — Enrichment Features

## Codebase Patterns
- Admin endpoints at `app/api/admin/` don't use `withAuth` wrapper (matches seed route pattern)
- `mapCategoryToSaver()` in `lib/budget/categorisation.ts` maps flat mjolnirCategoryId to `{ saverKey, categoryKey }`
- Tags are stored as JSONB arrays in upTransactions — use `jsonb_array_elements_text()` for querying
- Budget categories use `{saverKey}--{categoryKey}` as their ID format (e.g., `food--groceries`)
- Merchant tag patterns are case-insensitive, matched via `.toUpperCase().includes()`
- Toast feedback: use `showSuccess`/`showError`/`showInfo` from `lib/toast-helpers.ts` (wraps sonner)
- Optimistic updates: snapshot with specific query key (including filter params), revert in `onError`
- `classificationCorrections` table tracks saver/category edits — correction recorded in PUT endpoint after update
- Dismissed suggestions stored in localStorage under `mjolnir:dismissed-correction-suggestions`
- Raw SQL with `db.execute(sql\`...\`)` for GROUP BY + HAVING queries not expressible in Drizzle query builder

## 2026-02-13 - BI-D-001
- Created backfill API route at `app/api/admin/backfill/route.ts`
- Processes upTransactions missing saverKey in batches of 100
- Uses `mapCategoryToSaver()` for mjolnirCategoryId → three-tier mapping
- Built merchant description-to-tags mapping covering: WOOLWORTHS, COLES, ALDI, MARLEY SPOON, UBER EATS, DOORDASH, MENULOG, BODY FIT, MEDIBANK, AUSSIE BROADBAND, TELSTRA, ORIGIN ENERGY, REAL ESTATE, GHOST, BULK NUTRIENTS, MYPROTEIN, MYKI, UBER TRIP, JB HI-FI, APPLE.COM, OFFICEWORKS, COFFEE, ZIP PAY, ANZ CREDIT
- Merchant rules can also override saver/category (e.g., BODY FIT → essentials/fitness instead of generic health mapping)
- Idempotent: skips transactions that already have saverKey populated
- Returns summary with counts and sample of unmapped descriptions for manual review
- Files changed: `app/api/admin/backfill/route.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The admin seed route doesn't use auth — backfill follows same pattern
  - Use offset-based pagination for batch processing (not cursor) since we're updating rows in place
  - Income detection: positive amountCents with no other mapping → default to income/salary

## 2026-02-13 - BI-D-002
- Enhanced the inline tag editor in TransactionEditForm with chip/pill UI
- Tags now display as removable pills with X button (bg-primary/15 styling)
- New tags auto-formatted: lowercase, spaces→hyphens, special chars stripped, consecutive hyphens collapsed
- Tag input supports Enter/comma to add, Backspace to remove last tag, blur to commit pending input
- Added optimistic updates: UI updates immediately on save, reverts on error via onMutate/onError
- Added toast notifications via showSuccess/showError on mutation result
- Saver dropdown already resets category on change (pre-existing from BI-C-007)
- PUT endpoint already accepts saverKey, categoryKey, tags — no backend changes needed
- Files changed: `app/(dashboard)/budget/transactions/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Toast helpers at `lib/toast-helpers.ts`: showSuccess, showError, showInfo
  - For TanStack Query optimistic updates, snapshot the specific query key (with filters) not the broad `all` key
  - The `formatTag()` helper strips special chars, collapses hyphens, trims leading/trailing hyphens
  - `useRef<HTMLInputElement>` for focusing the tag input on container click

## 2026-02-13 - BI-D-003
- Created `classification_corrections` table in Drizzle schema with FK to upTransactions
- Indexes on merchant_description and (corrected_saver_key, corrected_category_key) for fast grouping
- Modified PUT `/api/budget/transactions/[id]/category` to capture original saver/category before update, insert correction record when classification actually changes
- Created GET `/api/budget/corrections/suggestions` endpoint: groups corrections by UPPER(merchant) + corrected saver/category, returns groups with 3+ corrections
- Built `CorrectionSuggestions` component with dismissible amber banners, "Copy Rule" button (copies JSON to clipboard), localStorage-based dismissal tracking
- Added query key `budget.corrections.suggestions` to centralised query-keys.ts
- Integrated banner into budget page after AI Check-in card
- Generated migration `0021_mute_sunset_bain.sql` (also includes health_daily and health_workouts tables)
- Files changed: `lib/db/schema.ts`, `app/api/budget/transactions/[id]/category/route.ts`, `app/api/budget/corrections/suggestions/route.ts` (new), `components/budget/correction-suggestions.tsx` (new), `app/(dashboard)/budget/page.tsx`, `lib/query-keys.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `db.execute(sql\`...\`)` for complex aggregation queries with GROUP BY/HAVING — Drizzle query builder doesn't support these well
  - `rows.rows` pattern for accessing raw SQL results from `db.execute()`
  - Correction tracking: capture original values BEFORE the update, compare AFTER to detect actual changes
  - localStorage-based dismissal with `Set<string>` pattern: serialize as JSON array, deserialize into Set
  - Migration may bundle unrelated tables if schema changes were pending — this is expected and safe
