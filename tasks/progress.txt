## Codebase Patterns
- Project uses Next.js 16+ App Router with TypeScript
- Drizzle ORM is already installed (`drizzle-orm`, `drizzle-kit`, `@neondatabase/serverless`)
- shadcn/ui components available in `components/ui`
- Dark mode only - no light mode support
- Quality checks: `npm run build` and `npm run lint`
- ESLint 9 with flat config format (eslint.config.mjs) - do not use .eslintrc.json
- Next.js 16 doesn't have `next lint` command - use `eslint .` directly

- Database module uses lazy initialization via Proxy to avoid build-time errors when DATABASE_URL is not set
- Use `sql` template tag from drizzle-orm for raw SQL queries with `db.execute(sql\`...\`)`
- ClerkProvider conditionally renders based on NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY to allow builds without Clerk keys
- Use `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` for pages/layouts that use Clerk components
- Dashboard routes at `/dashboard` and `/profile` are protected; landing page `/` is public
- Auth pages use `(auth)` route group; dashboard uses `(dashboard)` route group

- Drizzle migrations are stored in `drizzle/` directory and should be committed to git
- The holdings schema exists in `lib/db/schema.ts` with all required fields
- Transactions schema exists with action enum: BUY, SELL, DIVIDEND, SPLIT

- TanStack Query provider is in `components/providers/query-provider.tsx` - wrap layouts with QueryProvider
- ClerkProvider wrapper is in `components/providers/clerk-provider.tsx` - handles missing Clerk keys gracefully
- Use `useAuthSafe` hook from `lib/hooks/use-auth-safe.ts` for client-side auth state that works with/without Clerk
- Holdings page is at `/holdings` using `app/(dashboard)/holdings/page.tsx`
- Transactions page is at `/transactions` using `app/(dashboard)/transactions/page.tsx`

- Toast notifications use Sonner - import `toast` from `sonner` and use `toast.success()` / `toast.error()`
- Toaster component is in root layout; for dark mode only, hardcode `theme="dark"` in Sonner component

- Dashboard navigation uses `components/dashboard/nav.tsx` with usePathname for active state
- Navigation items defined in array for easy extension
- ESLint no-case-declarations: wrap switch case blocks containing `const`/`let` declarations in braces `{ }`

- API patterns:
  - Use innerJoin with holdings to validate user ownership AND include holding info
  - Return 409 Conflict for duplicate prevention (unique constraint violations)
  - Return 400 with `{ errors: { field: "message" } }` for validation errors
  - Decimal fields from Drizzle come as strings, need Number() conversion for arithmetic

- Calculation helpers in `lib/calculations/`:
  - `quantity.ts` - calculateQuantityHeld for tradeable holdings
  - `cost-basis.ts` - calculateCostBasis with FIFO methodology

- Snapshots and contributions schema: uses `employer_contrib`/`employee_contrib` (not `employer_contribution`) for DB column names to avoid migration renames

- Query helpers in `lib/queries/`:
  - `snapshots.ts` - getLatestSnapshots() and getLatestSnapshotForHolding() for fetching most recent snapshots

- Calculation helpers in `lib/calculations/`:
  - `super-returns.ts` - calculateInvestmentReturns() and calculateMonthlyInvestmentReturns() for super fund performance

- Check-in status API at `/api/check-in/status` returns holdings needing current month snapshots
- Dashboard components in `components/check-in/` for monthly check-in workflow
- Quote paths with parentheses in bash git commands: `git add "app/(dashboard)/..."`

- Edit modals pattern: components/[domain]/edit-[entity]-modal.tsx structure
- For related entity editing (e.g., contributions for super snapshots), fetch existing data with useQuery and handle create/update based on existence

- Neon MCP tools can be used to run migrations when DATABASE_URL is not configured locally
- Migration snapshot chain: each snapshot's prevId must point to the previous migration's id to avoid collision errors

- Price services in `lib/services/`:
  - `yahoo-finance.ts` - fetchStockPrice() with normalizeSymbol() for ASX/NZX suffixes
  - `coingecko.ts` - fetchCryptoPrice() using symbol-to-ID mapping
  - `exchange-rates.ts` - getExchangeRate() with 1-hour cache
  - `price-cache.ts` - getCachedPrice(), setCachedPrice() with 15-minute TTL
  - `price-fetcher.ts` - fetchPrice() unified interface routing to correct provider
  - `crypto-symbols.ts` - getCoinGeckoId() mapping for 60+ tokens

- Holdings table in `components/holdings/holdings-table.tsx` includes:
  - PriceCell with stale/error indicators and retry button
  - MarketValueCell calculating quantity x price
  - GainLossCell showing unrealized gain/loss with percentage

- Net worth calculation in `lib/calculations/net-worth.ts`:
  - `calculateNetWorth(userId)` returns NetWorthResult with netWorth, totalAssets, totalDebt, breakdown by type
  - `calculateAssetBreakdown(userId)` returns AssetBreakdown with percentage for each type and holding
  - Uses `calculateQuantityHeld()` for tradeable assets, `getLatestSnapshots()` for snapshot-based assets
  - All values converted to AUD via `getExchangeRate()`

# W-7 Net Worth Calculation Progress Log

Started: 2026-02-01

---

## 2026-02-01 - US-001
- Implemented net worth calculation service in `lib/calculations/net-worth.ts`
- Files changed: lib/calculations/net-worth.ts (new file)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Net worth calculation reuses existing helpers: `calculateQuantityHeld()`, `getLatestSnapshots()`, `getCachedPrice()`, `getExchangeRate()`
  - Breakdown includes both per-type grouping AND per-holding details
  - Debt is tracked separately from assets (debtBreakdown field)
  - Holdings with no cached price are included in breakdown with value=0 for visibility

---

## 2026-02-01 - US-002
- Implemented `calculateAssetBreakdown(userId)` function in `lib/calculations/net-worth.ts`
- Files changed: lib/calculations/net-worth.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Added new types: `HoldingWithPercentage`, `AssetBreakdownItem`, `AssetBreakdown`
  - Assets sorted by value descending
  - Debt treated as separate category (percentage = 100% since it's its own group)
  - `addHoldingPercentages()` helper to calculate percentage within a group
