# Ralph Progress Log — B5: AI Pay Split Recommendations
# This file is reset at the start of each epic.

## Codebase Patterns
- Schema uses `jsonb` from drizzle-orm/pg-core for JSON columns
- Budget-related tables (budgetPeriods, budgetAllocations) use `bigint` with `mode: "number"` for cents
- All tables follow the pattern: uuid PK with `defaultRandom()`, timestamptz columns with `defaultNow()`
- Relations defined separately using `relations()` from drizzle-orm
- Migration generated with `npm run db:generate`, files in `drizzle/` directory
- Type inference exports at bottom of schema.ts: `$inferSelect` and `$inferInsert`

## 2026-02-08 - B5-001
- Implemented `ai_recommendations` table in `lib/db/schema.ts`
- Columns: id (uuid PK), budget_period_id (uuid FK), recommendation_data (jsonb), status (varchar default 'pending'), created_at (timestamptz)
- Added index on `budget_period_id`
- Added relation from `budgetPeriods` → `aiRecommendations` (one-to-many)
- Added `aiRecommendationsRelations` for the reverse relation
- Added `AiRecommendation` and `NewAiRecommendation` type exports
- Generated migration: `drizzle/0014_square_songbird.sql`
- Files changed: `lib/db/schema.ts`, `drizzle/0014_square_songbird.sql`, `drizzle/meta/`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `jsonb` import was not in the existing drizzle import list — had to add it
  - Index definition uses the third argument to `pgTable` (callback returning object)
  - yahoo-finance2 Node version warning is expected and safe to ignore
