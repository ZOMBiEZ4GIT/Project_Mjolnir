# Ralph Progress Log — B4: Budget Dashboard & Sankey
# This file is reset at the start of each epic.

## Codebase Patterns
- Budget tables: budgetPeriods, budgetAllocations, budgetCategories, upTransactions in lib/db/schema.ts
- DB import: `import { db } from "@/lib/db"` with Drizzle ORM
- Budget categories use string slug IDs (e.g. "groceries", "income")
- Income category ID is "income" with isIncome=true
- Amounts stored in cents as bigint (mode: "number")
- Transactions: negative amountCents = debit, positive = credit
- Exclude transfers: `eq(upTransactions.isTransfer, false)`, soft-deletes: `isNull(upTransactions.deletedAt)`
- Calculation functions return rich typed objects (see lib/calculations/net-worth.ts for pattern)
- Use Promise.all for concurrent DB queries where possible

## 2026-02-08 - B4-001
- What was implemented: Budget summary calculation engine in lib/budget/summary.ts
- Files changed: lib/budget/summary.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Don't destructure placeholder values from Promise.all — causes unused variable lint errors
  - Two-phase fetch needed: first get period dates, then fetch income/spending with those dates
  - SQL aggregation pattern: `sql<number>\`COALESCE(SUM(col), 0)\`` for safe nulls
  - Category status thresholds: under (<80%), warning (80-100%), over (>100%)
