# Ralph Progress Log — B2: Budget Categories & Setup
# This file is reset at the start of each epic.

## Codebase Patterns
- Budget tables use varchar PK slugs (e.g. 'groceries') instead of UUIDs for readability
- Seed scripts use `onConflictDoNothing()` for idempotent seeding
- Schema follows existing pattern: `timestamp("name", { withTimezone: true }).defaultNow().notNull()` for created_at
- Existing API routes use manual validation (no Zod), but PRD requests Zod for budget routes
- `withAuth(async (request, context, userId) => { ... }, "context")` is the standard auth pattern
- Budget utility functions live in `lib/budget/` — pure functions with no DB dependency
- PaydaySettings interface: `{ paydayDay: number; adjustForWeekends: boolean }` — reuse for API validation
- Budget monetary values use `bigint("column", { mode: "number" })` for cents — same pattern as UP Bank tables
- Cascade delete: `references(() => parent.id, { onDelete: "cascade" })` — used for allocations on period delete

## 2026-02-07 - B2-001
- What was implemented: budget_categories table in schema.ts, seed-categories.ts with 9 default categories
- Files changed: lib/db/schema.ts, lib/db/seed-categories.ts, drizzle/0011_breezy_william_stryker.sql
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Schema uses varchar(255) for slug-based PKs, varchar(7) for hex colours
  - Default categories: bills-fixed, groceries, transport, eating-out, shopping, health, fun, income, uncategorised
  - Lucide icon names used: Home, ShoppingCart, Car, UtensilsCrossed, ShoppingBag, Heart, Gamepad2, DollarSign, HelpCircle
  - Migration generated as 0011_breezy_william_stryker.sql

## 2026-02-07 - B2-002
- What was implemented: payday_config table in schema.ts, lib/budget/payday.ts with pure date utility functions
- Files changed: lib/db/schema.ts, lib/budget/payday.ts, drizzle/0012_aspiring_joshua_kane.sql
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - payday_config uses uuid PK (unlike budget_categories which uses varchar slugs) — single-user, single-row table
  - Date utilities are pure functions with PaydaySettings interface (paydayDay, adjustForWeekends) — no DB dependency
  - Weekend adjustment: Saturday→Friday, Sunday→Friday (both shift backwards to Friday)
  - Budget period = payday to day-before-next-payday (inclusive both ends)
  - createPaydayDate clamps to last day of month for February edge cases

## 2026-02-07 - B2-003
- What was implemented: budget_periods and budget_allocations tables in schema.ts with relations and TypeScript types
- Files changed: lib/db/schema.ts, drizzle/0013_smooth_overlord.sql
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - budget_periods uses uuid PK, unique constraint on start_date, indexes on start_date and end_date
  - budget_allocations has cascade delete on budget_period_id FK — deleting a period removes its allocations
  - budget_allocations uses unique constraint on (budget_period_id, category_id) for one allocation per category per period
  - Money stored as bigint cents (mode: "number") — same pattern as upAccounts.balanceCents
  - Relations: budgetPeriods → many allocations, budgetAllocations → one budgetPeriod + one category
  - Migration generated as 0013_smooth_overlord.sql
